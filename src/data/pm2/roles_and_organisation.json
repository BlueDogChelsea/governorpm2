Stakeholders can be directly involved in a project's work, members of other internal organisations or external to the organisation (e.g. contractors, suppliers, users or the general public).\nThe number of stakeholders depends on the complexity and scope of a project. However, the more people the project has an impact on, the more likely it is that it will affect people who have some power or influence over the project. Given that stakeholders can be useful supporters of the project or may choose to block it, the effective management and involvement of them is crucial for its success."

For the project to succeed, these people need to work together as a team.\n\n#### Business Governing Layer\n\nThe Business Governing Layer determines the vision and strategy for the organisation as a whole. It consists of one or more management committees operating at a high or the highest management level. It is here that priorities are defined, investment decisions are made, and resources are allocated.\n\n#### Steering Layer\n\nThe Steering Layer provides general project direction and guidance. It keeps the project focused on its objectives. It reports to the Appropriate Governance Body (AGB). The Steering Layer is composed of the roles defined in the Directing and Management Layers plus other optional roles.\n\n#### Directing Layer\n\nThe Directing Layer champions the project and owns its Business Case. It mobilises the necessary resources and monitors the project's performance in order to realise the project's objectives. The Directing Layer comprises the roles of Project Owner (PO) and Solution Provider (SP).\n\n#### Managing Layer\n\nThe Managing Layer focuses on day-to-day project management. It organises, monitors and controls work to produce the intended deliverables and implement them in the business organisation. Members of the Managing Layer report to the Directing Layer. The Managing Layer comprises the roles of Business Manager (BM) and Project Manager (PM). It is of utmost importance for the success of the project that there is close collaboration and good communication between these two roles.\n\n#### Performing Layer\n\nThe Performing Layer carries out the project work. It produces the deliverables and implements them in the business organisation. Members of the Performing Layer report to the Managing Layer. The Performing Layer comprises the roles of the Business Implementation Group (BIG) and the Project Core Team (PCT)."
