The Closing Phase starts with the Project-End Review Meeting and ends with the Project Owner’s (PO) final approval, which marks the project’s administrative closure. During the Closing Phase, the project’s activities are completed, the project’s final state is documented, and the finished deliverables are officially transferred to the Project Owner (PO).\n\n![](/pm2/figures/fig-8-1.png)\n\n**Fig 8.1** Closing Phase activities and main outputs\n\n### Artefacts\n\n- Ready for Closing (RfC)\n- Project-End Review Agenda / MoM\n- Project-End Report\n  - Lessons Learned\n  - Best Practices\n  - Post-Project Recommendations\n- Project Acceptance Note\n\n**Fig 8.2** Closing Phase artefacts"

      "markdown": "## 8.3 Lessons Learned and Post-Project Recommendations\n\nThe purpose of formal Lessons Learned and Post-Project Recommendations is to ensure that the organisation benefits from the experience gained during the project. It is also the place to capture ideas for post-project work, extensions, maintenance, or follow-up projects.\n\n**Note:** Improvement opportunities and recommendations should be captured as they arise during the project—otherwise they risk being forgotten by the time the project reaches the Closing Phase.\n\n### **Key Participants**\n- **Project Manager (PM):** Organises the lessons-learned activities.\n- **Project Core Team (PCT):** Contributes insights and perspectives.\n- **Business Manager (BM):** Provides the requestor/business perspective.\n- **Other stakeholders:** Optional contributors, depending on context.\n\n### **Guidelines**\n- Conduct the Lessons Learned session during the Project-End Review Meeting (or separately if needed).\n- If possible, have the session facilitated by someone independent of day-to-day project work.\n- Use a structured format (phases, categories, themes) so no area is missed.\n- Consider surveys or interviews to reach a broader stakeholder group.\n- Organise improvement ideas into meaningful groups.\n- Multiple sessions may be useful for large or complex projects.\n- Invite the Project Steering Committee (PSC) to support organisational learning.\n\n### **Outputs**\n- Lessons Learned (consolidated)\n- Post-Project Recommendations\n- Inputs to the Project-End Report\n"
